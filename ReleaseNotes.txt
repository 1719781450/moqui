Moqui Framework Release Notes

===========================================================================
Release 1.0-beta1 - Date not yet decided
===========================================================================

The 1.0-beta1 release is the first feature-complete release for the 1.0
series. Following this release the focus for the framework shifts from
implementation to testing and to building applications and tools based on
it (in Moqui Framework, Moqui Mantle, and in other Moqui-based projects).

This release includes:

- All the great features of releases 1.0-preview1 to 1.0-preview3
- Changed UserAccount so that userId is internal/sequenced and a new
  username field is used for auth/login
- Some fixes so that Moqui will run in Java on Windows
- Testing and fixes for EntityFindImpl.count()
- Testing and fixes for screen.transition.*-response parameters
- Testing and fixes for screen.transition with no actions or conditional
  responses to act as an alias, even with parameters/etc
- Seed data changes to follow the Mantle pattern where enumTypeId is the
  same as entity.relationship.@title for Enumerations
- XML Screens
  - Screen form-list form-list-column support
  - Screen form-single field-layout support
  - Screen form-list pagination (defaults in search-form-inputs)
  - Template for csv render mode (mainly for form-list report-like output)
  - Support URL parameters for renderMode and pageNoLimit which along with
    the lastStandalone parameter make it easy to reuse screens and forms
    meant for user interaction as definitions for CSV output
- WebApp event actions for after-startup, before-shutdown
- Service Facade
  - Incoming email handling with Email ECA Rules (emeca) with the
    org.moqui.impl.EmailServices.pollEmailServer service, configured with
    the EmailServer entity
  - Service (org.moqui.impl.EmailServices.sendEmailTemplate) to send email
    based on settings in the EmailTemplate entity

Notable features not yet implemented (for 1.0):

- XML Screens
  - Template for xsl-fo render mode, FOP transform to PDF
  - Template for text render mode (for email alternative message, etc)
  - Template for xml render mode (like CSV, but more structured and
    support multiple forms per screen)
- Password reset email and forgot password form
- Tools Screens
  - Entity
    - Entity Data UI (entity list, find on entity with delete, view entity
      record with related, create/update entity record with tabs for
      list/update/delete/add dependent entities)
    - Entity Data Import and Export screens
    - SQL Query Run/View
    - Entity model internal check (relationship, view-link.key-map, ?)
    - Database meta-data check/report against entity definitions
  - Scheduler (view scheduled services with cancel, add scheduled service)
  - Script Run (or groovy shell?)
  - Security screens (consider making Entity Data UI good enough for these)
    - UserAccount screens (find/delete, edit UA (with tabs for preferences,
      themes, login, history, visit history, groups, change password))
    - UserGroup screens (find/delete, edit (tab for users in group))
    - Artifact Group (find/delete, edit (tab for artifacts in group))
    - Authorization screen (find/delete, edit (tabs for record, service))
  - Artifact Info screens (with in/out references for all)

===========================================================================
Release 1.0-preview3 - 19 Mar 2011
===========================================================================

Moqui 1.0-preview3 introduces various features to automatically and easily
make the applications you build using the previously available tools easier
to deploy and administer, and easier to test and get information about what
is happening as artifacts are executed. These include multi-tenant support,
artifact hit and hit bin tracking (for screens, transitions, services, and
entities), database-driven artifact authorization with many advanced
options, XML-RPC and JSON-RPC calls for Moqui services, and Tools screens
to administer and get information about various parts of the framework.

NOTE: just before this release the official code repository for Moqui moved
from SourceForge SVN to Git on GitHub so that users can more easily create
Git forks for their own use, and to allows pulls from their Git forks back
into the main Moqui repository. The Moqui GitHub URL is:

https://github.com/jonesde/moqui

This release includes:

- All of the great features of 1.0-preview1 and 1.0-preview2
- Updated various libraries included (esp Groovy, ehCache, Quartz)

- JSON-RPC 2.0 outgoing service runner (with Dzhuvinov JSON-RPC)
- XML-RPC incoming service handler (with Redstone XML-RPC)
- XML-RPC outgoing service runner (with Redstone XML-RPC)
- XML Screens
  - Screen form client JS validation based on target transition service
    definition (define once, run on client and server); using jquery
    validation (http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation); so far for
    required, number-integer, number-decimal, text-email, text-url,
    text-digits, credit-card; try out on the Edit Example screen

  - ArtifactExecutionFacade for artifact stack tracking
  - Artifact Authorization based on configuration in db
  - Call ArtifactExecutionFacade.push(aei) (to track, check authz, etc) for
    screen, transition, service, entity
  - Disable authz on data loading; command line and assumed to be safe
  - Handle direct service/entity calls, ArtifactGroupMember with pattern
  - Review and test to determine which entities can skip authz for view
    and create (ie some view only, some create only, some view and create)
  - For entity-implicit service calls just look for entity authz
  - Support authorization on subscreens even if no authz on parent
    screens, ie authz for EditExample even though not for ExampleApp or

  and moved configuration to entity definition, and methods to EntityValue
- Cleanups for xml-actions elements: from-field to from, call-service to
  service-call, call-script to script; better now than later to make the
  XML a bit cleaner and more clear (for example from-field can be any
  groovy expression and the -field implies otherwise)
- Significantly more testing and bug fixes related to synchronization,
  performance (WAY faster, but more room for improvement), transactions,
  style, etc

===========================================================================
Release 1.0-preview2 - 01 Mar 2011
===========================================================================

With release 1.0-preview2 the Moqui Framework is now nearly complete and
has sufficient functionality to build a wide variety of functional and
useful enterprise, or less formal, applications. This release includes a
functional example application with various screens demonstrating features
of the framework and recommended practices and patterns to use when
developing with Moqui.

While not feature-complete for the planned 1.0 feature set, the
1.0-preview2 release is ready for early adopters. For those interested,
this is a great time to try out Moqui for a pet project or even a more
formal project that is just getting started and won't be deployed in
production for at least a few months.

Feedback on functionality and bugs by early adopters would be extremely
helpful for the project at this point, both to validate (or invalidate...)
designs and to more extensively test the implementation.

This release includes:

- All of the great features of 1.0-preview1
- Significant updates to Example application screens (most now working)
- Added various configuration options and examples for flexible deployment
  and overriding templates for screen macros, xml-actions, etc
- Executable WAR file is more self-contained, ie less required in runtime
  but with a few more override options in runtime too
- Root web screen split to support undecorated subscreens and apps

- XML Screens
  - Screen form elements, all implemented (including file upload, *-find)
  - Standalone screens that are rendered independently of parent screens
    and can still be subscreens of any other screen
  - Screen pre-actions that all run before any parent screen is rendered
    to allow for setting parameters in parent screens, setting up general
    things, etc
  - Screen single-form HTML uses fieldset and label instead of a table
  - Screen form header-field widget rendering
  - Screen form header-field.@show-order-by support
  - Screen form localized output formatting, based on service parameter
    format if applicable, otherwise on format specified in form field
  - Output encoding, configurable on various screen/form elements
  - I18n (with L10nFacade) for labels and titles in screens, forms, menus
  - Added jquery and jquery-ui and the smoothness theme
  - Added container-dialog widget that creates a button that when clicked
    on opens a dialog with the contents of the container-dialog.
  - Added datetimepicker, which is the standard jquery datepicker plus the
    timepicker add-on, combined using some code from Apache OFBiz
  - Extended and now using database-driven screen visual themes
  - Can send Maps to HTTP response as JSON string (Web Facade), example of
    this is in EditExample.xml

  - Service expand auto-parameters, get parameters from implements
  - Finished implementation of async/scheduled service calls
  - Service run on commit and on rollback of current tx
  - Service parameter type/subtype checking
  - Service parameter ESAPI/Antisamy HTML checks (any/safe/none)
  - Service authentication
  - Service parameter conversion/parsing and validation checks

    configuration on the database element in the Moqui conf file
  - Database meta-data support for adding indexes when tables added
  - Automatically add columns if missing in table check
  - Add foreign keys to existing tables when table created
  - Added EntityDbMeta.createForeignKeysForExistingTables() to check the
    foreign keys of all entities with existing tables and add missing ones
    where both tables exist; useful to run once all desired tables have
    been created (through a data load, test script, etc) to round out the
    DB meta-data

- XML Screens
  - Screen form AJAX/DHTML for lookup
