README for the runtime/conf Directory

A configuration directory under this directory will be selected at runtime. Having multiple configuration directories
facilitates differing configurations for different environments, such as: development, staging, and production.

Place files in the configuration directory to override those in the framework/conf-default directory.
Any configuration files not present in the active directory will be used from the framework/conf-default directory.
